                    We know that the recent round of lay-offs has been very bad for company morale.
                    Not only are people worried about losing their jobs, but many 
                    people are having to cover additional duties that are not part of 
                    their job descriptions. We also know that both before and during this time, 
                    you have worked tirelessly to keep your department going. Not only do you 
                    complete excellent quality work yourself but we have seen you help your 
                    coworkers as well. You come in early stay late and even use your lunch break 
                    to help pitch in and get things done. Furthermore, 
                    you do this all with a fantastic attitude and willing disposition.
